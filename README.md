# EECS1012
Coursework in EECS1022 Net-centric programming. The learning kit features computational problems with their corresponding solutions and flowcharts. Ideas such as computational problem-solving strategies such as recursion and nested loops were used. Another file features a building navigation website.

Project title: Buildings at York University Keele campus
Description: This program allows the user to search for images of various buildings present at
York University. The purpose of this program is to enable students to familiarize themselves with
York Keele campus, and know the different buildings and their functions. Users can
search a building from the ‘database’ listed on the side of the web page to view the
image of the building in the display area.

important changes:

	removed requirements:
		9. A list of “most searched” buildings is stored in the database and presented to the user.
		12. Top 5 recent searches; browsing history. It is a drop-down under the search bar.

	Extra one added:
		NEW. A map button underneath the picture of the building allows the user to look at the map of the building when the button is pressed.
        	NEW 2. A predictive dropdown of all the buildings for ease of search when the search bar is pressed.

	other changes:
		the database is put on the left side on the right side.


all requirements:
	1. The system has a search bar that allows users to type to search images
	2. The user can view an image of the building that is searched in JPG format
	3. The website has a color scheme consisting of red, white, and black to match the York University color scheme.
	4. Clicking the logo on the top left of the page will redirect the user to the homepage
	5. System prompts “Building not found” message is displayed if the user enters the name of a building that is not on the list
	6. Every image of the building has a brief caption of its purpose
	7. A list of buildings is stored in a database that the user can access through the server
	8. A list of “most searched” buildings is stored in a database and presented to the user
	9. You can view the image of a building by clicking on an element in the database
	10. The system allows the user to reset their search and look up another building
	11. The system allows the user to search abbreviations/keywords of the building as well if they don't know the full name (on schedules, abbreviations are used instead of full name)
